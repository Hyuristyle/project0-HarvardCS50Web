#### About
FINA PHO (Fine Art Phone Photography) is a personal fine art phone photography gallery.

Now written in Django, HTML, Sass/CSS, Bootstrap 4, and JavaScript. It uses the Open Sans font from Google Fonts API, and icons from Font Awesome.
It was originally static and written purely in HTML, Sass/CSS and Bootstrap 4, for the sake of Project 0's scope and requirements, but now it's been refactored to use Django and its templating system.
