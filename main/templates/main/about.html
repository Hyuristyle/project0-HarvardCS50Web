	<h5>The Platform</h5>
	<p>
		With ever improving smartphone cameras, it is suddenly possible to start exploring our visual creative impulses at any place, at any time, even in the most casual or mundane of the situations. There are still several limitations, like: non-removable lens, small sensor size, low pixel quality, lots of compression applied, lack of fine detail, limited dynamic range and, if you zoom-in too much on a photo taken with a phone—oh, boy!—it looks nasty. But it already got to a point where you can satisfiably capture that great shot you've just envisioned looking through a small hole on a train station, at golden hour, while waiting for the train to arrive, but that you'd not be able to capture because you don't have your bigger camera with you and the camera would be too big to put in between those pillars anyway... Or that nice natural light coming through one of your bedroom's windows, in the morning, when you've just woken up. You can just grab your phone from your pocket, find the right angle, snap a couple of photos and—click!—you've got the moment captured before breakfast.<br>
		The very-portable-camera era is upon us and it allows us to register our perspectives quickly. No more forgotten ideas, no more lost opportunities.<br>
		FINA PHO(Fine Art Phone Photography) is an output for channeling those creative impulses you have with your phone from time to time, for sharing your unique photographic perspective, and, maybe, even learn a thing or two along the way. All of that, without the noise of social media. It's like an art gallery for phone photography.

	<p>
		A little bit scientist, a little bit musician, a little bit filmmaker. Totally addicted to learning, and improving things.<br>
		Currently, an Independent Filmmaker based in São Paulo.<br><br>

		My interest in photography actually came from my interest and studies in cinematography. I would say my approach to photography is cinematography minus the motion dimension—a frame capture of a shot I see in my head.<br><br>
		
		In any case, I've just started playing around with phone photography and I'm still just learning and experimenting.
