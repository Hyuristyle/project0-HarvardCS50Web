	<h1>Tools</h1>

	<h5>The Basics</h5>
	<p>
		A phone;<br>
		Your own unique way of seeing the world coupled with a little bit of knowledge;<br>
		Lots of sunlight/available light;
	</p>
	<p>
		A set of mini lenses(made for phones), if you want to get serious;<br>
		A tripod(with an adapter), or mini tripod. Especially needed if you plan on shooting long exposure and/or HDR;<br>
		A flashlight—or any other portable light fixture—is quite fun for experimenting in dark places;
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're <i>really</i> serious about it, it might be a good idea to try calibrating the colors of your phone screen. There are devices and apps to help you with that but since I have not done this on my phone, I won't recommend any specific products. Searching for "screen color calibration" should give you a starting point(look for the smaller and more portable devices because, not only they'll be more than enough, but also most color calibration systems are quite expensive).
	</p>

	<br>

	<h5>Apps</h5>
	<p>
		Camera:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Built-In Camera App</b> — Can get you started, but you'll really need manual controls to get the results you envision, so this one will very quickly become a limitation;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Lightroom CC</b> — Manual controls, and RAW;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Manual Camera</b> (Android-only) — Manual controls, and RAW;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Manual — RAW Camera</b> (iOS-only) — Manual controls, and RAW;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Hypocam</b> — Dedicated to Black & White. Several features, including colored filters.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br>

	<p>
		Editing:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Built-In Photo Editor</b> — In most cases, I don't do any post-processing and try to get most of the shot in-camera, but when I do want to make adjustments, it's usually a slight Crop, Contrast or Saturation adjustment, so the built-in app is more than enough;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Snapseed</b> — Lots of tools and great controls. It has double exposure, selective adjustments, curves, film grain and many more;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Lightroom CC</b> — The presets system is quite useful for small adjustments;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Pixlr</b> — Many tools and lots of presets. Some presets are pretty nice. It also has a nice collage tool;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Hypocam</b> — Dedicated to Black & White. Several features, including colored filters and film grain;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>LightX</b> — The controls aren't great but I like its splash(selective adjustment) tool.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<p>
		Scouting:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Sun Locator</b> (Android-only) — Shows you at what position the Sun will be throughout the day, and other info;
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Sun Scout</b> (iOS-only) — Shows you at what position the Sun will be throughout the day, and other info.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I'd recommend you spend some time with each one of them to see which ones you prefer.
	</p>

	<h5>The Extra Mile</h5>
	<p>
		If you want to go deeper with your post-processing, for the desktop I recommend <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> + the <a href="https://gmic.eu/">G'MIC</a> and <a href="http://registry.gimp.org/node/25219">Resynthesizer</a> plug-ins.
